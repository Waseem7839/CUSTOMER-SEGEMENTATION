# ðŸ§  Customer Segmentation using Clustering

This project applies clustering techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to enable targeted marketing strategies. It includes both model development and a Streamlit-based deployment app.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that share similar characteristics. This project uses unsupervised learning (clustering) to analyze customer data and group customers accordingly.

### âœ… Objectives

- Understand customer behavior through clustering.
- Implement and compare multiple clustering algorithms.
- Visualize and interpret the resulting customer segments.
- Deploy an interactive Streamlit application for end-user analysis.
